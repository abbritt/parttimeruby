this will allow compliance to transform our hawaii data into a really stupid format that hawaii likes. prevents
having to manually upload like 3k contributions.

1) pull for hawaii contributor data from our system. save as hawaii_data
2) Go to hawaii's upload website and download their names table. save as hawaii_names.csv
  -the hawaii_names files must only have the first name of the contributor and their hawaii id. delete other columns before proceeding
3) Run the main "hawaii.rb" script. It will output a payments.csv.
4) run the columns script on "payments.csv" to match and insert columns that hawaii needs for its template. this is what you'll upload.
